        <h1>Japanese Curry</h1>
        <img src="../images/curry.png">
        <p>Japanese curry is a reliably delicious and relatively low effort meal
            that can also be customized remarkably easily.  You can replace the
            chicken with your choice of meat, and you can easily add most
            vegetables to it.  While it's traditional to eat it with rice, you 
            can use quinoa or riced caulifower, or just eat it like a stew instead.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1.5 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs, cubed</li>
            <li>2 medium yellow onions, finely sliced</li>
            <li>2 sweet potatoes, cut into large chunks</li>
            <li>2 large carrots, cut into large wedges</li>
            <li>Chicken stock</li>
            <li>Japanese curry mix</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp ketchup</li>
            <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
            <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp fish sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat olive oil and in a Dutch oven or stock pot then brown chicken over medium heat</li>
            <li>Remove chicken and set aside in a separate bowl.  Add a little more
                oil, then add onions, sprinkle a little Kosher salt, and sautee onions until they're soft.</li>
            <li>Push onions to side of pot then add sweet potatoes and carrots in center.
                Mix well and allow the vegetables to cook until the carrots have begun to soften.</li>
            <li>Return the chicken to the pot then pour enough chicken stock to just barely cover the ingredients and scrape up any fond from the bottom of the pot.
                Bring it to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and let it cook for 45 minutes, occasionally stirring.</li>
            <li>Add the curry mix one cube at a time, stirring gently until the cube melts and is incorporated into liquid.
                Allow the curry to cook for 15 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining ingredients, stir well so they're mixed into the rest sauce, and let it cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
